    "1) Delayed Implementation: Starting with high-level design and planning before coding individual modules or functions can lead to delayed implementation. This can result in longer development cycles and potentially slower response to changing requirements or user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Difficulty Managing Complex Logic: Handling complex algorithms or intricate program logic can be challenging when using a top-down approach. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces from a high-level perspective may not be straightforward, leading to code that is harder to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Potential for Inefficient Solutions: In some cases, a top-down approach may lead to less efficient solutions. When you design the overall structure of a program before considering the specific implementation details, you may overlook opportunities for optimization or fail to consider alternative, more efficient approaches to solving a particular problem. This can result in software that consumes more resources than necessary or performs poorly."
